To Build On Mac (clang gcc doesn't support -fopenmp, use 'brew install gcc' to install gcc-10 and g++-10):
g++-10 -fopenmp -O2 -Wall Driver.cpp QuadTree.cpp

To Build on Linux:
g++ -fopenmp -O2 -Wall Driver.cpp QuadTree.cpp

To Run:
./a.out
python animate.py

Configure number of bodies, mass distribution, etc. in the driver file.

./a.out should produce a data file containing the location histories of all bodies. 'python animate.py' will produce an mp4 file of the simulation.
